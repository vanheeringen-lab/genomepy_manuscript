## Conclusion
Obtaining suitable genomic data is a principal step in any genomics project.
With genomepy, finding available assemblies becomes trivial.
A genome, with the desired sequence masking, level of biological diversity, and contigs can be obtained with a single command.
Gene annotations in GTF and BED12 format, and matching the genome, can similarly be obtained, with further options available in the Python API.
Whatever install options you choose are logged, for reproducibly, allowing you to start your analysis with confidence.

    Obtaining and preprocessing genomic data can be performed and tweaked on the command line interface and Python API, with expanded options in the Python API.

    Here we have given an overview demonstrated how to generate an overview of genomes on the three major providers, and how reproducibly download and process genomic data using genomepy.
    Genomepy provides full control via its command line and Python application programming interfaces.
    This allows genomepy to automate a step in Omics research that was previously required to be performed by hand.
