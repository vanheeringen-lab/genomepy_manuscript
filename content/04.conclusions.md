## Conclusion
A principal step in all science is making informed decisions.
For genomics projects, choosing a genome to serve as reference assembly is no different.
Genomepy offers an overview of the three largest genome providers, serving as a catalyst for this step.

After choosing an assembly, data must be downloaded and processed for compatibility with downstream tools.
Genomepy provides this functionality, which includes downloading, zipping and unzipping, converting, filtering and altering of the data, while providing logging of the steps undertaken.
Even if the required reference data is not available on the three largest genome providers, genomepy can process external data to provide a consistent output.

While genomepy makes choices during the processing, each of these can be tuned to the specific needs of a project using the CLI or Python API.
Combined, these features make genomepy ideal for integration in automated sequencing workflows, as demonstrated in seq2science @doi:10.5281/zenodo.3921913.

### Future prospects
As science strives to become more open, genomepy assists by making the discussed steps easier, and make the output more FAIR @doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18.
One method by which this can be further improved is coupling genomepy with a data management tool, such as one discussed in the related works.
