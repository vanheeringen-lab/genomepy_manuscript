## Conclusion
Obtaining suitable genomic data is a principal step in any genomics project.
Genomepy was developed to provide a consistent overview of genomes on the three major providers, and reproducibly download and process genomic data ready for downstream use.
Using genomepy, a project can utilize genomes from any provider and expect consistent output with data from a major provider or otherwise.
This allows genomepy to automate a step in genomic data preprocessing that was required to be performed by hand.
Additionally, it facilitates downstream analysis, by setting up paths to the genome FASTA file, providing genome metadata within the Python Genome object and generating support files.
Combined, these features make genomepy ideal for integration in automated sequencing workflows, as demonstrated in seq2science @doi:10.5281/zenodo.3921913, paving the way for robust and reproducible analysis.
