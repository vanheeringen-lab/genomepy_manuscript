## Conclusion
Obtaining suitable genomic data is a principal step in any genomics project.
Here we demonstrated how to generate an overview of genomes on the three major providers, and how reproducibly download and process genomic data using genomepy.
Genomepy provides full control via its command line and Python application programming interfaces.
This allows genomepy to automate a step in Omics research that was previously required to be performed by hand.
