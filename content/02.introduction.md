## The maze of genomes
Its big, its vague, and you just want to run your pipeline yesterday, right?

| Database | Fun aspect |
|:--|:--|
| Ensembl | Updates infrequently, chromosome names don't play nice |
| UCSC    | GTFs labelled incorrectly                              |
| NCBI    | Different pipelines, looks like Ensembl                |

## What is genomepy
search, download, sensible defaults, reproducible, automatable.
about those defaults...

## How does genomepy fit in the ecosystem
### Similar tools
its not like refgenie, but they could work nicely with eachother!

### Within workflows
automatically download genomes, gene annotations, generate genome metadata and (splice-aware) genome indexes.
Reference usage in seq2science.

## How genomepy works
Install via conda, pip or git. Run via CLI or API.

### CLI
basic steps.

### API
same steps, but in API.
