## Features of genomepy
The key features of genomepy are 1) providing an overview of available assemblies with the `search` function, 
2) download and processing of a selected assembly, with the `install` function and 3) utilizing assembly data using the Python API.

The `search` function queries the databases of GENCODE, Ensembl, UCSC and NCBI (caching the metadata), for text, taxonomy identifiers or assembly accession identifiers.
The input type is automatically recognized and used to find assemblies that have the text in the genome names or various description fields, 
matches the taxonomy identifier or (partially) matches the assembly accession.
The output of the `search` function is a table with rows of metadata for each assembly found.
The metadata contains the assembly name and accession, taxonomy identifier, 
and indicates whether a gene annotation can be downloaded (or which of the four UCSC annotations) (see fig. 1a).
Snippets of available gene annotation(s) can be inspected with the `annotation` function (fig. 1b).

```bash
$ genomepy search GRCh38

An assembly name can be passed to the `install` function (fig. 1c).
The genome FASTA file is downloaded with the desired sequence masking level [@http://repeatmasker.org; @doi:10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1028] and alternate sequences (softmasked and none by default, respectively).
Alternate sequences to reflect biological diversity and are often contained in reference assemblies.
During sequence alignment however, similar reference sequences result in multiple alignment, leading to loss of data (as discussed in @doi:10.1186/s13059-015-0587-3).
Additional filters may be passed to either include or exclude contigs (chromosomes, scaffolds, etc.) by name or regex pattern.
Once processed, a genome index is generated using pyfaidx @doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.970v1, as well as contig sizes and contig gap sizes.

Gene annotations come in a variety of recognized formats (GFF3, GTF, BED12).
The `install` function will download the most descriptive format available, to output the commonly used GTF and BED12 formats.
Contig names of the genome and gene annotation sometimes mismatch, which makes them incompatible with tools such as splice-aware aligners.
Therefore, genomepy will attempt to match the contig names of the gene annotations to those used in the genome FASTA.

The `install` function can be extended with postprocessing steps via plugins.
The options can be inspected and toggled with the `plugin` function.
Briefly, the blacklist plugin downloads blacklists by the Kundaje lab @doi:10.1038/s41598-019-45839-z for the supported genomes.
Other plugins support the generation of aligner indexes, including DNA aligner indexes for Bowtie2 @doi:10.1038/nmeth.1923, BWA @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324, GMAP @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bti310 or Minimap2 @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191, and splice-aware aligners such as STAR @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635 and HISAT2 @doi:10.1038/nmeth.3317.

Assemblies not present on the major providers can be processed similarly by supplying the URLs or file paths to the `install` function.
For data provenance and reproducibility, a README file is generated during the installation process with time, source files, processing steps, and filtered contigs.

These features are available on both the command line interface and Python API.
Additional features are available on the Python API, focussed around two classes.
The `Genome` class can be used to extract exact or random sequences from the FASTA, filter the FASTA and list the contigs, contig sizes and contig gaps.
The `Annotation` class can be used to browse and filter the BED12 or GTF files as pandas dataframes @doi:10.5281/zenodo.3509134, 
map gene identifiers to other types using mygene.info @doi:10.1186/s13059-016-0953-9, 
map chromosome names to naming schemes of other major providers,
and create a dictionary of any two GTF columns or attribute fields (to easily convert gene identifiers to gene names for instance).
