    "abstract": "Here, we present CellOracle, a computational tool that integrates single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), critical regulators of cell identity. Leveraging inferred GRNs, we simulate gene expression changes in response to transcription factor (TF) perturbation, enabling network configurations to be interrogated in silico, facilitating their interpretation. We validate the efficacy of CellOracle to recapitulate known regulatory changes across hematopoiesis, correctly predicting the outcomes of well-characterized TF perturbations. Integrating CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of direct reprogramming reveals distinct network configurations underlying different reprogramming failure modes. Furthermore, analysis of GRN reconfiguration along successful reprogramming trajectories identifies new factors to enhance target cell yield, uncovering a role for the AP-1 subunit Fos, with the hippo signaling effector, Yap1. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, at high-resolution, promoting new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.",

    "abstract": "As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided athttp://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to over 3000 different users.",

One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.",

    "abstract": "The pyfaidx Python module provides memory and time-efficient indexing, subsetting, and in-place modification of subsequences of FASTA files. pyfaidx provides Python classes that expose a dictionary interface where sequences from an indexed FASTA can be accessed by their header name and then sliced by position without reading the full file into memory. pyfaidx includes an extensive test suite to ensure correct and reproducible behavior. A command-line program (faidx) is also provided as an alternative interface, with significant enhancements to functionality, while maintaining full index file compatibility with samtools. The pyfaidx module is installable from PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfaidx), and development versions can be found at Github (https://github.com/mdshw5/pyfaidx).",
